To run this code, you will first need:
1. VSCode
2. Live Server Extension


After installing that, here are the steps to run it:
1. Download the code and put them all in the same folder.
2. Right click on index.html and click "Open With Live Server"
3. It will open in your browser and you can use it like a normal website.

Some notes:
The links on the bottom only work for my GitHub and LinkedIn. The twitter and instagram are placeholders, but can be replaced with my account links if needed.
The contact page works but does not send to anywhere yet. It can be implemented in the future if needed.
